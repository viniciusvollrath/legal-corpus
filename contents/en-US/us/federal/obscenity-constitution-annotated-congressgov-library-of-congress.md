# Obscenity | Constitution Annotated | Congress.gov | Library of Congress

First Amendment:

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Although public discussion of political affairs is at the core of the First Amendment, the guarantees of speech and press are broader, extending also, for example, to sexually explicit entertainment. The Supreme Court has rejected the idea that the First Amendment applies only to the exposition of ideas, saying [t]he line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right.1 The right to impart and to receive information and ideas, regardless of their social worth . . . is fundamental to our free society.2 Accordingly, obscene material, referring to certain sexually explicit material,3 may be protected even if it is arguably devoid of any ideological content.4 Nonetheless, while sexually explicit material may be entitled to constitutional protection, the Court has said the subcategories of obscenity and child pornography—the latter discussed in a subsequent essay—can generally be regulated without triggering heightened scrutiny.5

Adjudication over the constitutional law of obscenity began in Roth v. United States,6 in which the Court ruled that obscenity is not within the area of protected speech and press.7 The Court undertook a brief historical survey to demonstrate that the unconditional phrasing of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance.8 All or practically all the states that ratified the First Amendment had laws making blasphemy or profanity or both crimes, and provided for prosecutions of libels as well. This history was deemed to demonstrate that obscenity, too, was outside the protection intended for speech and press.9 The Court said that although [a]ll ideas having even the slightest redeeming social importance were entitled to First Amendment protections, implicit in the history of the First Amendment is the rejection of obscenity as utterly without redeeming social importance.10 Because obscenity was not protected at all, tests such as clear and present danger, which the Court had previously applied to assess the constitutionality of other laws, were irrelevant.11

The Court clarified, however, that, sex and obscenity are not synonymous. Obscene material is material which deals with sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest. The portrayal of sex, for example, in art, literature and scientific works, is not itself sufficient reason to deny material the constitutional protection of freedom of speech and press . . . . It is therefore vital that the standards for judging obscenity safeguard the protection of freedom of speech and press for material which does not treat sex in a manner appealing to prurient interest.12 The Court identified the relevant standard for unprotected obscenity as whether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.13 The Court defined material appealing to prurient interest as material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts, and defined prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.14

In the years after Roth, the Court considered many obscenity cases. The cases can be grouped topically, but, with the exception of those cases dealing with protection of children,15 unwilling adult recipients,16 and procedure,17 these cases are best explicated chronologically. In Manual Enterprises v. Day,18 the Court upset a Post Office ban upon mailing certain magazines addressed to homosexual audiences, but none of the Court’s opinions gained the support of the majority. Nor did a majority opinion emerge in Jacobellis v. Ohio, which reversed a conviction for exhibiting a motion picture.19 In Ginzburg v. United States,20 the Court held that in close cases borderline materials could be determined to be obscene if the seller pandered them in a way that indicated he was catering to prurient interests. On the same day, the same five-Justice majority affirmed a state conviction under a law prohibiting distributing obscene books by applying the pandering test and concluding that courts could hold material to be legally obscene if it appealed to the prurient interests of the deviate group to which it was directed.21 On the same day, however, the Court held that Fanny Hill, a novel, which at that point was 277 years old, was not legally obscene.22 The Court’s prevailing opinion restated the Roth tests that, to be considered obscene, material must (1) have a dominant theme in the work considered as a whole that appeals to prurient interest, (2) be patently offensive because it goes beyond contemporary community standards, and (3) be utterly without redeeming social value.23

After the divisions engendered by the disparate opinions in the three 1966 cases, the Court over the next several years submerged its differences by issuing per curiam dispositions in nearly three dozen cases in which it reversed convictions or civil determinations of obscenity in all but one. The initial case was Redrup v. New York,24 in which, after noting that the cases involved did not present special questions requiring other treatment, such as concern for juveniles, protection of unwilling adult recipients, or proscription of pandering,25 the Court succinctly summarized the varying positions of the seven Justices in the majority and said: [w]hichever of the constitutional views is brought to bear upon the cases before us, it is clear that the judgments cannot stand . . . .26 Although the Court’s subsequent cases followed the pattern established in Redrup,27 the Court’s changing membership led to speculation about the continuing vitality of Roth and the Court’s Redrup approach.28

At the end of the October 1971 Term, the Court requested argument on whether the display of sexually oriented films or of sexually oriented pictorial magazines, when surrounded by notice to the public of their nature and by reasonable protection against exposure to juveniles, was constitutionally protected.29 By a 5-4 vote during the October 1972 Term, the Court in Paris Adult Theatre I v. Slaton adhered to the Roth principle that the First and Fourteenth Amendments do not protect obscene material even if access is limited to consenting adults.30 Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Warren Burger observed that the states have wider interests than protecting juveniles and unwilling adults from exposure to pornography; legitimate state interests, effectuated through the exercise of the police power, exist in protecting and improving the quality of life and the total community environment, in improving the tone of commerce in the cities, and in protecting public safety. Consequently, Chief Justice Warren reasoned, it does not matter that the states may be acting based on unverifiable assumptions in deciding to suppress the trade in pornography because the Constitution does not require, in the context of the trade in ideas, that governmental courses of action be subject to empirical verification any more than it does in other fields. Chief Justice Warren further noted that the Constitution does not embody any concept of laissez-faire, or of privacy, or of free will, that curbs governmental efforts to suppress pornography.31

In Miller v. California,32 the Court prescribed the currently prevailing standard by which courts identify unprotected pornographic materials. Because of the inherent dangers in regulating any form of expression, the Court noted, laws to regulate pornography must be carefully limited and their scope confined to materials that depict or describe patently offensive ‘hard core’ sexual conduct specifically defined by the regulating state law, as written or construed.33 The Court further reasoned that law must also be limited to works which, taken as a whole, appeal to the prurient interest in sex, which portray sexual conduct in a patently offensive way, and which, taken as a whole, do not have serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.34 The Court disavowed and discarded the standard that a work must be utterly without redeeming social value to be suppressed.35 In determining whether material appeals to a prurient interest or is patently offensive, the trier-of-fact, whether a judge or a jury, is not bound by a hypothetical national standard but may apply the trier-of-fact’s local community standard.36 Prurient interest and patent offensiveness, the Court indicated, are essentially questions of fact.37 By contrast, the prong of the Miller test that looked at the material’s value is not subject to a community standards test; instead, the appropriate standard is whether a reasonable person would find [literary, artistic, political, or scientific] value in the material, taken as a whole.38

The Court in Miller reiterated that it was not permitting an unlimited degree of suppression of materials. Only hard core materials were to be deemed without the protection of the First Amendment, and the Court’s idea of the content of hard core pornography was revealed in a few plain examples of what a state could regulate: (a) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated. (b) Patently offensive representations or descriptions of masturbation, excretory functions, and lewd exhibition of the genitals.39 Subsequently, the Court held that a publication was not obscene if it provoked only normal, healthy sexual desires.40 To be obscene it must appeal to a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion.41 The Court has also indicated that obscenity is not be limited to pictures; books containing only descriptive language may be suppressed.42

First Amendment values, the Court stressed in Miller, are adequately protected by the ultimate power of appellate courts to conduct an independent review of constitutional claims when necessary.43 While the Court had said juries as triers-of-fact should determine, based on their understanding of community standards, whether material was patently offensive, it was less clear how appeals courts could appropriately review these jury determinations. In Jenkins v. Georgia,44 the Court, while adhering to the Miller standards, stated that juries [do not] have unbridled discretion in determining what is ‘patently offensive.’ Miller was intended to make clear that only hard-core materials could be suppressed and this concept and the Court’s descriptive itemization of some types of hardcore materials were intended to fix substantive constitutional limitations, deriving from the First Amendment, on the type of material subject to such a determination.45 Viewing the motion picture in question convinced the Court that [n]othing in the movie falls within either of the two examples given in Miller of material which may constitutionally be found to meet the ‘patently offensive’ element of those standards, nor is there anything sufficiently similar to such material to justify similar treatment.46 But, in a companion case, the Court found that a jury determination of obscenity was supported by the evidence and consistent with the standards.47

While the Court’s decisions from the Paris Adult Theatre and Miller era were rendered by narrow majorities,48 they have since guided the Court. For example, the Court struck down federal regulations aimed at preventing the transmission of indecent materials over the telephone and internet, where those statutes did not adhere to the Miller standard.49 Even as to materials falling within the constitutional definition of obscene, the Court has recognized a limited private, protected interest in possession within the home,50 unless those materials constitute child pornography. In Stanley v. Georgia, the appellant appealed his state conviction for possessing obscene films that police officers discovered in his home pursuant to a search warrant for other items which the police did not find. The Court reversed, holding that mere private possession of obscene materials in the home cannot be a criminal offense. The Constitution protects the right to receive information and ideas, the Court said, regardless of their social value, and that right takes on an added dimension in the context of a prosecution for possession of something in one’s own home. The Court stated: For also fundamental is the right to be free, except in very limited circumstances, from unwanted governmental intrusions into one’s privacy.51 Despite the Court’s unqualified assertion in Roth that the First Amendment did not protect obscenity, the Court remained concerned with the government interest in regulating commercial distribution of obscene materials. Though the Stanley Court said its decision did not impair Roth and cases relying on that decision,52 by rejecting each state contention in support of a conviction, the Court appeared to reject much of Roth’s basis. In Stanley, the Court made the following points: (1) there is no government interest in protecting an individual’s mind from the effect of obscenity; (2) the absence of ideological content in films is irrelevant, since the Court would not distinguish transmission of ideas and entertainment; (3) no empirical evidence supported a contention that exposure to obscene materials may incite a person to antisocial conduct and, even if such evidence existed, government may address this by enforcing laws proscribing the offensive conduct; (4) it is not necessary to punish mere possession in order to punish distribution; and (5) private possession was unlikely to contribute to the problems prompting laws barring public dissemination of obscene materials or exposing children and unwilling adults to such materials.53

The Court has confined Stanley's holding to its facts and has also dispelled any suggestion that Stanley applies outside the home or recognizes a right to obtain or supply pornography.54 For instance, the Court has held Stanley does not apply to possessing child pornography in the home because the state interest in protecting children from sexual exploitation far exceeds the interest in Stanley of protecting adults from themselves.55
