# A Brief Overview of the Federal Trade Commission's Investigative, Law Enforcement, and Rulemaking Authority | Federal Trade Commission

This memo focuses on law enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission (“Commission” or “FTC”). Appendices A and B are charts that synopsize antitrust and consumer protection powers under the FTC, Clayton, and Sherman Acts. Summaries of Commission enforcement authority under other statutes are available on this site, including links to statutes discussed below.

I. Investigative Authority
A. In General
The Commission may “prosecute any inquiry necessary to its duties in any part of the United States,” FTC Act Sec. 3, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 43, and is authorized “to gather and compile information concerning, and to investigate from time to time the organization, business, conduct, practices, and management of any person, partnership, or corporation engaged in or whose business affects commerce, excepting banks, savings and loan institutions . . . Federal credit unions . . . and common carriers . . .” FTC Act Sec. 6(a), 15 U.S.C. Sec. 46(a).(1) Pre-complaint investigations are generally non-public. However, Commission policies may allow identification of investigations where the Commission determines the public interest warrants it or a merging party or target has disclosed the existence of the investigation.(2)

B. Specific Investigative Powers
The Commission’s specific investigative powers are defined in Sections 6, 9, and 20 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. Secs. 46, 49, and 57b-1, which authorize investigations and various forms of compulsory process. In addition, the premerger notification provisions in Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 18a, prohibit consummation of covered acquisitions until the parties provide the Commission with the requested information.

1. Sections 9 and 20 of the FTC Act
Section 9 of the FTC Act authorizes the Commission to “require by subpoena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of all such documentary evidence relating to any matter under investigation.” 15 U.S.C. Sec. 49. Any member of the Commission may sign a subpoena (pursuant to a Commission-issued resolution for compulsory process in the matter), and both members and “examiners” (employees) of the agency may administer oaths, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. Id.; Commission Rule 2.5, 16 C.F.R. Sec. 2.5.

If a party fails to comply with a subpoena, the Commission may seek enforcement of the subpoena in “[a]ny of the district courts of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such inquiry is carried on.” 15 U.S.C. Sec. 49. After the Commission files its petition to enforce a subpoena, and following receipt of any response from the subpoena recipient, the court may enter an order requiring compliance. Refusal to comply with a court enforcement order is subject to penalties for contempt of court.

The Bureau of Competition routinely uses the subpoena provisions of Section 9 to investigate alleged unfair methods of competition and other antitrust violations. By virtue of the FTC Act Amendments of 1994, the Bureau of Competition also may use “civil investigative demands” (“CIDs”) for investigations of possible antitrust violations. However, the Bureau of Consumer Protection may use only CIDs, rather than subpoenas, to investigate possible “unfair or deceptive acts or practices.” FTC Act Sec. 20, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 57b-1. The scope of a CID is different from that of a subpoena. Both subpoenas and CIDs may be used to obtain existing documents or oral testimony. But a CID may also require that the recipient “file written reports or answers to questions.” 15 U.S.C. Sec. 57b-1(c)(1). In addition, Section 20 expressly authorizes the issuance of CIDs requiring the production of tangible things and provides for service of CIDs upon entities not found within the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 57b-1(c)(7)(B).

Under Commission Rule 2.10, 16 C.F.R. Sec. 2.10, a party may raise objections to a subpoena or a CID by filing a petition to limit or quash. Such petitions will be resolved by the full Commission. The Commission may petition a federal district court to enforce the subpoena or CID in the event of noncompliance, although permissible venue is narrower in a CID enforcement action than in a subpoena enforcement case.

2. Section 6(b) of the FTC Act
Section 6 of the FTC Act provides another investigative tool. Section 6(b) empowers the Commission to require an entity to file “annual or special . . . reports or answers in writing to specific questions” to provide information about the entity’s “organization, business, conduct, practices, management, and relation to other corporations, partnerships, and individuals.” 15 U.S.C. Sec. 46(b). As with subpoenas and CIDs, the recipient of a 6(b) order may file a petition to limit or quash, and the Commission may seek a court order requiring compliance. If a party fails to comply with a 6(b) order after receiving a notice of default from the Commission, the Commission may commence suit in federal court under Section 10 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 50. After expiration of a thirty-day grace period, a defaulting party is liable for a penalty for each day of noncompliance. Id.; Commission Rule 1.98(f), 16 C.F.R. Sec. 1.98(f).

The Commission’s 6(b) authority also enables it to conduct wide-ranging studies that do not have a specific law enforcement purpose. Section 6(f) authorizes the Commission to “make public from time to time” portions of the information that it obtains, where disclosure would serve the public interest. 15 U.S.C. Sec. 46(f). An example is the Commission’s October 2016 report on “Patent Assertion Entity Activity.”

3. Section 6(f) and Section 21 of the FTC Act
Section 6(f) also authorizes the agency to share confidential information with other appropriate enforcement agencies, subject to appropriate limitations and confidentiality assurances. This allows the FTC and other law enforcers to cooperate and minimize duplication in investigations.

Section 21, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 57b-2, establishes the conditions and procedures for confidential treatment of various types of materials and information obtained by the Commission.

4. Section 21b of the FTC Act
Section 21B, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 57b-2b, protects certain entities (for example, internet service providers and consumer reporting agencies) from liability for voluntary disclosures to the Commission about suspected fraud or deception, about recovery of assets for consumer redress or about consumer complaints sent to them.

5. Premerger Notification
In merger investigations, the Commission also relies on Section 7A of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 18a, which was added by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act of 1976. Under Section 7A, parties to covered mergers or acquisitions must notify the FTC and the Department of Justice before consummating the proposed acquisition and wait a specified number of days before consummation. In general, certain proposed acquisitions of voting securities, non-corporate interests or assets must be reported to the FTC and the Department of Justice prior to consummation. Whether a particular acquisition is subject to the Section 7A requirements depends upon the value of the acquisition and the size of the parties, as measured by their sales and assets. Should the Commission or the Department of Justice decide that further examination is warranted, it may seek additional information or documentary materials by issuing a “second request” to the parties. When such a request is issued, the waiting period is extended and the subject transaction may not be consummated until the conclusion of a specified period following the parties’ compliance with the request. Although parties are not obligated to comply with a second request, consummation of the transaction without complying is illegal. Thus, the premerger notification provisions of the Clayton Act are a powerful incentive for companies to submit information that the government needs to evaluate acquisitions. Should the parties consummate the transaction without observing the requirements of the Clayton Act, the Commission may seek both injunctive relief and civil penalties, as appropriate, under Section 7A(g) of the Clayton Act. The Commission may also grant an early termination of a waiting period. More information about premerger notification (including Notices of early termination) is available here.

6. Pharmaceutical Agreement Filings
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 requires that brand name drug manufacturers and generic drug applicants file certain agreements with the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice within 10 business days of execution of the agreement and imposes penalties for noncompliance. Under the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices Act of 2018, certain agreements involving biosimilar biological drugs must be filed in the same way. Information about what types of agreements must be filed, filing deadlines, and where to file, is set forth here. Unlike the merger review process under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, there is no prescribed timetable for the FTC’s review. The FTC neither approves nor denies approval to the filed agreements.

7. International Investigations
Under the International Antitrust Enforcement Assistance Act (“IAEAA”), 15 U.S.C. Secs. 6201 et seq., the FTC may invoke all of its investigative tools to obtain materials or information from domestic sources for the use of foreign antitrust authorities, and may seek investigative assistance from those authorities, for antitrust matters, pursuant to mutual or bilateral assistance agreements established under the IAEAA. FTC Act Sections 6(i) and 20(a)(8)(C), 15 U.S.C. Secs. 46(i) and 57b-1(a)(8)(C), incorporate the IAEAA investigative authority into the FTC Act.

The “Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2006” (the “U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006” or “Safe Web”) (Pub. L. No. 109-455, extended by Pub. L. 112–203) added subsection (j) to Section 6, allowing the Commission to use all of its investigative powers to conduct investigations and discovery to help foreign law enforcement agencies in appropriate consumer protection matters. Section 6(j)(4), 15 U.S.C. Sec. 46(j)(4), authorizes the Commission, with the approval of the Secretary of State, to negotiate and conclude international agreements in the name of the United States or the Commission if foreign law requires an agreement as a condition for reciprocal assistance or information sharing. Safe Web amended Sections 6(f) and 21(b), 15 U.S.C. Secs. 46(f) and 57b-2(b), to authorize disclosure of confidential materials or information to foreign law enforcement agencies in consumer protection matters, subject to appropriate confidentiality constraints.
